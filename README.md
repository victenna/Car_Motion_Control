# Car_Motion_Control

Mini-project (for children) using the Python-Pygame library: a car moving along a road and controlled by the keyboard keys.
The car route is selected as an image. Road description does not require a cumbersome road map. If the car touches the side
borders of the road, it stops and then its motion is corrected with the keyboard keys. In order to prevent the car from 
leaving the road bounders, the collide_mask method is used to detect collisions between two images: a car and a road 
boundaries. The attached images: full program code (38 lines in total); road view and bottom right video shows how you 
can control car motion with keyboard control. Programming code and image files can be download free of charge at:
